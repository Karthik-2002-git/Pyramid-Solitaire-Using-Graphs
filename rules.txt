
The rules to pyramid solitaire are very simple to understand; the main goal is to remove all cards from the pyramid
structure of cards shown in the game.

The pyramid is made of 28 unique playing cards. These cards are split up into 7 rows in which row 1 has 1 card, row 2
has 2 cards, and so on. To remove cards from the structure, you must pick 2 accessible cards which add up to equal 13
(Aces = 1, Jack = 11, Queen = 12, King = 13). To remove a king, it must be picked first.

Although on this console game, all the cards in the pyramid are fully visible, the cards that you can access and pick
to be compared must be ones that aren't covered by any other cards. Therefore, to start with, only 7th row cards can be
used. To access the rows beneath, you must first remove the cards above. For example, to access the first card on the
6th row, you must remove the 1st and 2nd card from the 7th row - the second card from the 6th must not be "covered" by
the 2nd and 3rd cards of the 7th row and so on.

The rest of the cards are situated in the stock pile at the start of the game. The stock is a pile of face up cards
that can be used to help remove cards from the pyramid. Rotating the stock moves the top card from the stock to the top
of the waste pile. The top of the waste can also be used to compare with the pyramid (or stock for extra score). When
the stock is empty, the waste reverses it's order, copies to the stock and then empties itself.

There are 3 outcomes of the game, either the pyramid is removed, no more cards can be successfully compared, or the
game is prematurely ended. In all outcomes, you will be given a score based on how many cards you removed from the
pyramid, where in the pyramid the cards were removed from, and any extra cards that you may have removed from the
stock/waste.

Good luck and have fun!
